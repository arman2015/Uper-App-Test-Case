# Uper-App-Test-Case
You can submit a travel request via the app. Your location is automatically determined, and GPS information is logged. After that, it pairs you with the nearest available Uber driver. You can view a driver's name, license plate, photo, rating, and temporary backup phone number if they accept your trip.
